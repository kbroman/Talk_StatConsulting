### Talk on &ldquo;Statistical consulting: My experiences&rdquo;

These are slides for a talk that I gave on 8 Oct 2013, in the
statistical consulting course at UW&ndash;Madison.

The current pdf is [here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/openaccess.pdf).

They were totally not effective. I'd presented in that course a number
of times, but just speaking from notes, in an attempt to have an
informal discussion.
(I had turned my notes into this
[blog post](http://kbroman.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/thoughts-on-statistical-consulting/).)

I made the slides as an experiment (but not in the formal sense).
First, I wanted to test my
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/)/[Beamer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX))-based
template: I wondered, about 45 min before the class, whether I could
quickly make some reasonable slides. Second, I wondered whether it
would be useful to have slides for this presentation.

The slides were reasonable; my template was easy to use. But the
slides were unnecessary, and they interfered with the desired informal
nature of the discussion. Fortunately, the students were really good
and involved and asked great questions anyway.
